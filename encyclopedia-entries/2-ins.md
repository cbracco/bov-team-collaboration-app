# Ins HTML Tag

Insert tag

`ins` is an HTML tag for text insertion, commonly used with the `del` tag. Using the `ins` tag with the `del` tag will show users that text has been added from the previous version of the content by striking through the deleted text with a line and showing an underline for the inserted text. 

## Syntax

The `ins` tag has an opening and closing tag. Attributes for this tag are `cite` and `datetime` in addition to [global attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp) and [event attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp). The `cite` and `datetime` attributes' values are shown only in the code so users cannot see the date, time and cite information when browsing the web page.

```
  <ins cite="" datetime="">New Text</ins>
```

### Attributes

#### cite

The `cite`attribute shows the url of a document explaining the changes. This url is hidden but can be shown using CSS.

#### datetime

`datetime` shows the date and time when the text was inserted in the following format:  
`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD`
